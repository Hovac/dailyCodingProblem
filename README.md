# dailyCodingProblem

Here I will try to solve problems posted by dailycodingproblem.com
Since I am studying electrical engineering, I will try to solve the problems to the best of my capabilities, that includes trying to figure out most efficient way for an algorithm.
Problems that can be visualized will be visualized (dCP14 for example).
I will mostly skip problems that I haven't learned in university or encountered them on other projects (mainly nodes, binary trees, etc.)
